# FLUE: French Language Understanding Evaluation


**FLUE** is an evaluation setup for French NLP systems similar to the popular GLUE benchmark. The goal is to enable further reproducible experiments in the future and to share models and progress on the French language. The tasks and data are obtained from existing works, please refer to our [Flaubert paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05372) for a complete list of references.

A leaderboard will be updated frequently [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/leaderboard/).
